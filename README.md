# Overview
PaperTrail is a free and open source, self-hostable and privacy-friendly Discord bot designed to deliver structured, reliable logging across all major audit and runtime events. It hooks into Discord's audit logs to cover for most of the audit log events and for events not covered by Audit Logs, it supplements them with real-time listeners to bridge gaps in native coverage (e.g. voice state, boosts, message edits and deletions, custom triggers).

Key Features:

- Full audit log integration (supports over 50+ event types) and generic support for unknown types
- Encrypted Message logging  (edit, delete)
- Member activity tracking (joins, leaves, kicks, bans, updates)
- Voice activity logging (join/leave, move)
- Auto-deletion of logged messages after 30 days

> [!IMPORTANT]
> PaperTrail is currently in maintenance mode. Existing bugs will be fixed, dependency updates will be provided
> but large new features will likely not be added.

# Self-Hosting Guide
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that this is only for advanced users who want to self-host this bot
> 
> A pre-hosted instance is already available: https://discord.com/discovery/applications/1381658412550590475
>
> It is recommended that you deploy the [Persistence API](https://github.com/Egg-03/PaperTrail-PersistenceAPI?tab=readme-ov-file#papertrail-persistenceapi) service before deploying the bot itself since the bot relies on the URL of the service to communicate

## v1.2.2 Legacy
Checkout the guide for hosting the legacy version [here](https://github.com/Egg-03/PaperTrailBot/blob/legacy-v1.2.2/README.md).
v1.2.2 has unresolved bugs and runs on JDA 5. It is recommended to not use that version anymore.

## V2 and above
Since v2, the project has been split into two services:
1) The core bot service
2) A [Persistence API](https://github.com/Egg-03/PaperTrail-PersistenceAPI) service

The following guide shows how to set up the bot service

### Step 1: Get Required Secrets

You will need the following environment variables to run the bot:

| Variable         | Description                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TOKEN`          | Discord application bot token (from the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)) |
| `MESSAGE_SECRET` | Random secret string for encrypting/decrypting messages (generate yourself)                              |
| `API_URL`        | Internal URL of the Persistence API (e.g., `http://persistence:8080`)                                    |

### Step 2: Deployment Options

Fork this repository to your GitHub account, connect it to your preferred cloud platform, and configure your environment variables in the platform. Some paltform services may also support adding secrets directly from your `.env` file.

#### Cloud Platforms with GitHub + Docker Support
- These can auto-deploy using the included `Dockerfile`
- Optional: The bot exposes a `/ping` endpoint which can be used by platforms to periodically check for it's health

#### Locally
- You can also test it locally by building and running using the `Dockerfile`
- Navigate your terminal to the repository and execute the following commands
  
  ```
  docker build -t papertrail-bot .
  docker run --env-file .env papertrail-bot
  ```
  
#### Healthcheck Endpoint
The bot exposes a `/ping` endpoint on port **8080**.  
This endpoint simply returns `200 OK` and is intended for platforms or uptime monitors to check if the bot is alive.

> Note: This is **not a public API** and serves no other function beyond health monitoring.

# Privacy

PaperTrail is built with privacy-first principles. By default, it **does not log any personal data** unless features are explicitly enabled by server admins.

- Messages are logged for moderation purposes only, if enabled.
- All stored messages are encrypted before being saved to the database.
- Logs are automatically deleted after 30 days.
- No personal data is used for analytics, profiling, or sold to third parties.
- If requested, users can have their data deleted by ID.

*Never post sensitive information in public channels. While PaperTrail encrypts all the data it receives, other bots may not.*
