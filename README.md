> [!IMPORTANT]
> I've considered putting the project in maintenance mode since I believe it's mostly feature complete.
> I don't plan on introducing or changing anything major.
> However, I will be regularly updating it to fix reported/detected issues, updating dependencies and log new events or
event keys if found, for as long as I can.

# Using The Bot

### By Inviting It

A deployed instance is the easiest way to use this bot. Just invite it to your server and that's all.

Get it from here: https://discord.com/discovery/applications/1381658412550590475

Run the `/help` slash command to see instructions on how to configure the bot for your server.

### By Self Hosting It

Read the deployment guide [here](/DEPLOYMENT.md)

# License

This project is licensed under the [AGPLv3](/LICENSE) license.

# AI Usage Policy

While my code quality is questionable at best and qualifies as slop, no AI/LLM agents have been used to generate any
part of the code. This is my first bot and I wanted to write every part of the code by myself. This will also apply to
future updates as well.

That being said, I did use AI to proofread the Privacy Policy, Security and Terms documents and help maintain a formal
tone because turns out, I really do a bad job at writing in formal tone. I also used it for generating commit messages
sometimes, especially during early stages of development and when I did not know how to write helpful commit messages (I
think I still don't know).

# Help

If you face any problems during self-hosting or have a question that needs to be answered, please feel free to
open an issue in the Issues tab. I will try my best to respond as soon as I can.
