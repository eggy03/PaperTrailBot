# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently, only the `main` branch of PaperTrail is actively maintained. Bug fixes and security patches are applied there.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in PaperTrail, please **do not open a GitHub issue**. Instead, report it responsibly by contacting:

📧 **egg03@duck.com**

Please include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce, if possible
- Any known workarounds

We aim to acknowledge your report within **48 hours** and will keep you updated through the resolution process.

Once a fix is ready and released, we will credit reporters (if desired) and may publish a GitHub Security Advisory summarizing the issue and patch.

Thank you for helping keep PaperTrail safe and secure!
