# Privacy Policy

**_Data Controller:_**
For the official hosted instance of PaperTrail (Discord Application ID: 1381658412550590475),
[@Egg-03](https://github.com/eggy03) acts as the data controller.

**_Last Updated:_** February 27, 2026

**_Effective From:_** February 27, 2026

The Privacy Policy is a legal agreement between you ("you", "your", "user")
and the project maintainers of PaperTrail (collectively "we", "us", "PaperTrail").

The [bot](https://github.com/eggy03/PaperTrailBot),
its related
APIs, [1](https://github.com/eggy03/PaperTrail-API-Quarkus), [2](https://github.com/eggy03/PaperTrail-API-Spring),
and its [SDK](https://github.com/eggy03/PaperTrail-SDK)
are collectively referred to as the “Service.”

This Privacy Policy describes how the Service collects, uses, stores, and protects information when you use the
official hosted instance of the bot.

By inviting or using the Service in a guild, you acknowledge and agree to the practices described in this Policy.
If you do not agree, you should not use the Service.

The Service is open-source and provided free of charge on an “as-is” basis.

---

## Scope of This Policy

This Privacy Policy applies only to the official hosted instance operated by the maintainer listed above.

If you self-host PaperTrail or use a modified version of the code, that instance operates independently and is not
governed by this Privacy Policy.
In such cases, the operator of that instance is solely responsible for data handling and legal compliance.

Use of the open-source code itself is governed by the applicable software license.

---

## Information Collection

The Service collects and processes only the information necessary to provide logging functionality.
Features are disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled by server administrators.

Server administrators determine whether logging features are enabled within their guilds.
The Data Controller operates the Service and processes information solely in accordance with the configuration selected
by authorized server administrators.

### When Message Logging Is Enabled

The following data may be stored:

- Message content (text only)
- Message ID (unique ID of the message, provided by Discord API)
- Author ID (author ID of the message, provided by Discord API)
- Guild ID (the guild ID where the event has occurred, provided by Discord API)
- Channel ID (the channel ID where the logs will be sent, provided by Discord API)
- Timestamp (auto generated by the Service)

### When Audit Logging Is Enabled

The following data may be stored:

- Guild ID (the guild ID where the event has occurred, provided by Discord API)
- Channel ID (the channel ID where the logs will be sent, provided by Discord API)

### Direct Messages

The Service does not monitor, access, or store Direct Messages (DMs).
Only data from guilds where the bot has been explicitly invited is processed.

### Diagnostic Logs

For debugging and operational stability, the Service may log:

- Error messages
- Timestamps
- Internal system state
- Limited metadata (e.g., guild IDs, message IDs, or user IDs when necessary for debugging)

Diagnostic logs are not used for analytics or profiling purposes.

---

## Information Usage

Collected information is used solely to:

- Provide core functionality of the Service
- Maintain Service stability and diagnose technical issues
- Comply with legal obligations when required

We do not:

- Sell personal data
- Use data for advertising
- Profile users
- Conduct behavioral analytics

---

## Data Retention

We follow a data minimization approach.
Information is retained only for as long as necessary to provide the core functionality of the Service.

- **_Message Logs:_** All captured message content (text-only) and metadata are stored for a maximum period
  of 30 days. Following this period, data is programmatically purged from our production databases.
- **_System Backups:_** Data contained within database backups may persist for up to an additional 7 days beyond the
  standard retention period before being overwritten. Deleted data may remain in encrypted backups until overwritten in
  the normal backup rotation cycle.
- **_Configuration Data:_** Configuration settings (e.g. designated log channels) are retained as long as the bot
  remains authorized within the Discord Guild.
- **_Diagnostic Logs:_** Retained only as long as operationally necessary and may be periodically rotated or deleted.

---

## Data Sharing

We do not sell or rent personal data.

We may share data only:

- With infrastructure providers necessary to operate the Service
- In response to lawful requests by authorities
- To comply with legal obligations

### Infrastructure Providers

- Northflank (application hosting and managed database services)
- Aiven (managed redis services)

These providers act as data processors and are contractually bound to process data solely on our behalf.

## Data Security

We take reasonable steps to protect the information provided via the Services from
loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

Security is implemented using a shared-responsibility model.
Application-level access controls and data retention policies are managed by the Data Controller,
while infrastructure security (including physical security, network protection, and encryption) is provided by our
hosting providers.

**Encryption**

Collected data is stored in readable format within the database.
Infrastructure providers employ encryption at rest and other security controls at the platform level.

For more information, please review the security policies of our infrastructure providers:

- [Northflank](https://northflank.com/security)
- [Aiven](https://aiven.io/security-compliance)

**Access Control**

Access to the production environment and database is restricted to the Data Controller.
No other contributors have access to stored production data.

**Disclaimer**

While we use commercially reasonable measures to protect information,
no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure.
We cannot guarantee absolute security of stored data.

## Data Location

Infrastructure providers may process and store data in data centers located in various jurisdictions, depending on their
operational configuration.

## Third Party Links and Content

The Service may contain links to other sites not operated or controlled by us (the “Third Party Sites”).
The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites.

We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.

It does not knowingly collect personal information from children. If such data is discovered, it will be deleted upon
