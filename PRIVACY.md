# Privacy Policy

**Data Controller:** This project is maintained by [@Egg-03](https://github.com/eggy03).  

This Discord bot was built as an open source project with a privacy-first mindset.
The Service is provided at no cost and is intended for use as-is.

This page is used to inform users regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of information for anyone choosing to use the bot.

If you choose to use this bot in your Discord server, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
The data collected is strictly limited to what is necessary for the bot's core functionality and moderation features.

We do not sell your data.
We do not share personal data with third parties except where necessary to provide the service, such as cloud hosting and database providers, or in response to lawful requests.
Any third-party processors we use are bound by contractual data-protection requirements and may only process data on our behalf and for the purpose of providing the service.

## Scope of This Policy

This Privacy Policy applies **only** to the official hosted instance of this bot that is managed by [@Egg-03](https://github.com/eggy03).  
The official instance can be identified by its **Discord Application ID: `1381658412550590475`**.  

If you or someone else self-hosts the bot, that instance is operated independently and is **not covered by this Privacy Policy**.
In those cases, data handling is the sole responsibility of the host of that particular instance.

---

## Information Collection and Use

The bot only stores data when specific features are explicitly enabled by server administrators:

### If **Message Logging** is enabled:
- Message Content
- Message ID
- Author ID (Discord user ID)
- Channel ID
- Guild ID
- Timestamp

Message content is stored in plain text and is not used for analytics or shared outside your server.

### If **only Audit Logging** is enabled:
- Guild ID
- Channel ID where audit logs should be sent (one per guild)

No message content or user data is stored in this case.

The stored data is used solely for server moderation purposes.

---

## Data Retention

- All stored message contents and their metadata are automatically deleted after **30 days**.
- No data is permanently retained or used for any analytics.
- Configuration data (e.g., log channel IDs) is kept until the server administrator unregisters the bot or removes it from the server.
- Server administrators can also request immediate deletion of all stored data for their guild by contacting us.

---

## Diagnostic Logs

In case of runtime errors, the bot may log basic diagnostic information such as error messages, timestamps, and internal event states to assist with debugging.
Logs may include additional metadata such as guild IDs, channel IDs, message IDs, or user IDs when necessary to diagnose issues.

Log retention is governed by our infrastructure providers and operational requirements, and may vary over time.
Logs are not used for analytics.

---

## Security

We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect stored data from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.
This includes access controls, limited operator access, and infrastructure security best practices.

Message content is stored in plain text on cloud infrastructure.
This is the same general model used by Discord (i.e., messages are not end-to-end encrypted).
We do not perform analytics on message content.

However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

---

## Children’s Privacy

This bot is not intended for users under the age of 13. It does not knowingly collect any personal information from children.
If it is discovered that such data has been inadvertently stored, it will be deleted immediately upon request.

---

## User Rights

All users, regardless of location, have the following rights:

- **Right of Access**: You may request what data (if any) is associated with your Discord user ID.
- **Right to Erasure**: You may request deletion of your data from the database.

To protect user privacy, we will verify the identity of the requestor before fulfilling access or deletion requests (for example: confirmation from the guild owner or proof of control of the Discord user account).
We will respond to verified requests within 30 days.
If additional information is needed, we will notify you and may extend the response period where permitted by law.

To request access or deletion, please contact us using the method below.
